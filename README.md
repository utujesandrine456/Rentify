Rentify

Rentify is a mobile rental management application built with React Native and Spring Boot that helps landlords and tenants build trust through transparent rent payment tracking and verified tenant history.

Problem Statement

Many landlords lose money due to tenants leaving without paying rent, while honest tenants lack a trusted way to prove their payment history. Rentify solves this by creating a secure, shared rental record system.

Solution

Rentify provides a digital platform where:

Tenants record rent payments (Mobile Money or landlord-confirmed cash)

Landlords confirm payments and manage properties

Payment history builds a trusted tenant profile

Unpaid rent can be flagged to prevent repeat fraud
