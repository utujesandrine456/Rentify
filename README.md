🚀 Rentify

Rentify is a mobile rental management application built with React Native and Spring Boot that helps landlords and tenants build trust through transparent rent payment tracking and verified tenant history.

📌 Problem Statement

Many landlords lose money when tenants leave without paying rent, while honest tenants have no trusted way to prove their payment history.
This creates mistrust and financial loss on both sides.
